## Extended profile

My career in hardware (digital) design) started with NASA (as a co-op student) while working on a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree at the University of Florida. At NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (Huntsville, AL) I did hardware design, research in magnetohydrodynamic forming and laser technology, and (low-level) production design for the Saturn V booster. After three years I returned to UF for a MSEE, then several years’ work on a Ph.D. (not completed). I became a staff engineer then faculty member in the University of Florida College of Medicine.

During my many-year career at UF I progressed into software engineering, system engineering, and finally project management. I’ve produced several hardware/software computer systems for medical and other academic research labs. In software engineering I’ve worked with several computer languages (FORTRAN, BASIC, Pascal, LabVIEW) at the production level, and worked with others at a learning/classroom/tutorial level (Ada, COBOL, APL, DBase, C/C++, etc.).

For data engineering training in the last several years I've worked with Python, Docker, Airflow, and Amazon Web Services. My AWS projects have been on IoT Core, Timestream, and Grafana, as well as the more common core services (S3, EC2, Lambda, Glue, Cloud, Redshift).

As a hardware engineer much of my software work has been in assembler for numerous chips, starting with the Intel 4004 then on to MOS Tech 6502, RCA 1802, Motorola 68000 series, and later Intel chips. In recent years I've worked with Arduino and Espressif ESP32 development boards, modifying C/C++ code from sketches and tutorials.

My current focus is on IoT planning, architecture, and design, from the edge device level through an edge broker via Wi-Fi, LoRa, and/or Bluetooth, then into ‘the cloud’ for analysis and presentation.
