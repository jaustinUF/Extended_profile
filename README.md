Background

My degrees are in Electrical Engineering, starting my career in hardware (digital design) with NASA. During my many-year career at the University of Florida (staff, then faculty) I progressed through software engineering, system engineering, and finally project management. I’ve produced a number of hardware/software computer systems for medical and other academic research labs. In my software engineering practice I’ve worked with numerous languages (Ada, COBOL, APL, DBase, SQL, C/C++, etc); several (FORTRAN, BASIC, Pascal, LabVIEW) have been at a production level. As a hardware engineer, much of my software work has been with assembler for numerous chips, starting with the Intel 4004 then on to MOS Tech 6502, RCA 1802, Motorola 68000 series, and later Intel chips.
