Background

I started my career in hardware (digital) design) with NASA, After getting degrees in Electrical Engineering from The University of Florida.

During my many-year career at the University of Florida (staff, then faculty) I progressed through software engineering, system engineering, and finally project management. I’ve produced a number of hardware/software computer systems for medical and other academic research labs. In my software engineering practice I’ve worked with several computer languages (FORTRAN, BASIC, Pascal, LabVIEW) at a production level, and worked with a nuber at a learning/classroom/tutorial level (Ada, COBOL, APL, DBase, C/C++, etc). In data enginering training in the last several years I've worked with Python, Docker, Airflow, and a number of the AWS (Amazon Web Services) services, including IoT Core, Timestream, and Grafana, as well as the core services (S3, EC2, Lambda, Glue, Cloud0, Redshift

As a hardware engineer, much of my software work has been in assembler for numerous chips, starting with the Intel 4004 then on to MOS Tech 6502, RCA 1802, Motorola 68000 series, and later Intel chips. In recent years I've worked with Arduio and Espressif ESP32 development boards, mofifying C/C++ code from sketches and tutorials.
